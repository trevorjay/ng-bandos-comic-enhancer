# Bando's Comic Enhancer

Bando's Comic Enhancer is a simple bookmarklet that adds page preloading to the comic viewer on [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/).

## Install

### Desktop

Installing on desktop is usually as easy as dragging and dropping, follow the instructions [here](https://raw.githack.com/trevorjay/ng-bandos-comic-enhancer/main/install.html).

### Mobile

Bando's Comic Enhancer should be compatible with most mobile browsers. However, most mobile browsers restrict bookmarklet creation. The easiest way to circumvent this is to bookmark another site and then edit the title and URL. You can copy the needed URL from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevorjay/ng-bandos-comic-enhancer/main/bce.txt) and watch a [video of this being done on ios](https://raw.githack.com/trevorjay/ng-bandos-comic-enhancer/main/ios.gif).

## Usage

1) Visit the comic on NG.
2) Emedded post in the "gallery" format can be browsed as is, other formats require first launching the full page viewer.
3) Click your "BCE" bookmark.
4) Enjoy!

### Status Glossary

Once activated, Bando's Comic Enhancer will communicate its status by prefixing the page title with an emoji. In some browsers, you may need more than one page open before page titles are visible.
